- Clean, grid-based design using containers  
- Consistent spacing, padding, and alignment

- Minimal and unobtrusive legends (tooltips emphasized instead)  
- Consistent color palette across all visuals  
- Compact charts for optimal use of layout space

## Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tableau_dashboard.png` | Exported screenshot of the final dashboard |
| `tableau_project.twb` | Tableau workbook (requires the CSV to open) |
| `interactive_business_performance_dataset.csv` | Dataset used by the `.twb` workbook |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

### Important Note for Opening the Tableau Workbook
The file is a **.twb**, which does NOT embed the dataset.  
To open the dashboard correctly:

1. Download **both** the `.twb` and the `.csv` file.  
2. Place them in the **same folder** on your computer.  
3. Open the `.twb` in Tableau Public – it will automatically reconnect to the CSV.
